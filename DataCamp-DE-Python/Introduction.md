**What is data engineering?**

1. Data engineering and big data



​		**A Example of these data engineering concepts are implemented:**

​		A Data workflow as follows:

Data engineers are responsible for the first step of the process: ingesting collected data and storing it, so it's easily accessible and ready to be analyzed.



​		**A Data engineer's responsibilities:**

​		Ingest data from different sources

​		Optimize the databases for analysis

​		Manage data corruption

​		Develop, construct, test, and maintain data architectures



​		**Five Vs of Big Data: ** Volume (how much), Variety (what kind), Velocity (how frequent), Veracity 		(how accurate), Value (how useful).



2. Data engineering vs. data scientists

​		

​		Data scientists intervene on the rest of the workflow, they prepare the data according to their analysis, explore it, build insightful visualizations, and then run experiments or build predictive models.

3. Data pipeline





**How data storage works?**

1. Structured vs. Unstructured data
2. SQL
3. Data warehouse and data lakes



**How to move and process data?**

1. Processing data
2. Scheduling data
3. Parallel computing
4. Cloud computing
